In simple words, it's to understand whether a person is happy or unhappy in producing the piece of text. Why we (or rather, companies) care about sentiment in texts? It's because by understanding the sentiments in texts, we will be able to know if our customers are happy or unhappy about our products and services. If they are unhappy, the subsequent action is to figure out what have caused the unhappiness and make improvements.\n","\n","Basic sentiment analysis only understands the *positive* or *negative* (sometimes *neutral* too) polarities of the sentiment. More advanced sentiment analysis will also consider dimensions such as agreement, subjectivity, confidence, irony, and so on. In this challenge we will conduct the basic positive vs negative sentiment analysis based on real Twitter tweets.\n","\n","NLTK comes with a [sentiment analysis package](https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.sentiment.html). This package is great for dummies to perform sentiment analysis because it requires only the textual data to make predictions. For example:\n","\n","```python\n",">>> from nltk.sentiment.vader import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer\n",">>> txt = \"Ironhack is a Global Tech School ranked num 2 worldwide.   Our mission is to help people transform their careers and join a thriving community of tech professionals that love what they do.\"\n",">>> analyzer = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()\n",">>> analyzer.polarity_scores(txt)\n","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.741, 'pos': 0.259, 'compound': 0.8442}\n","```\n","\n","In this challenge, however, you will not use NLTK's sentiment analysis package because in your Machine Learning training in the past 2 weeks you have learned how to make predictions more accurate than that. The [tweets data](https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140) we will be using today are already coded for the positive/negative sentiment. You will be able to use the Naïve Bayes classifier you learned in the lesson to predict the sentiment of tweets based on the labels."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"pmSYNVGJeMDP"},"source":["## Conducting Sentiment Analysis\n","\n","### Loading and Exploring Data\n","\n","The dataset we'll be using today is located on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140). Once you have downloaded and imported the dataset, it you will need to define the columns names: df.columns = ['target','id','date','flag','user','text']\n","\n","*Notes:* \n","\n","* The dataset is huuuuge (1.6m tweets). When you develop your data analysis codes, you can sample a subset of the data (e.g. 20k records) so that you will save a lot of time when you test your codes."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"xT5Js2Z4eMDQ"},"outputs":[],"source":["# your code here"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":850},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":7273,"status":"ok","timestamp":1656278962582,"user":{"displayName":"Alberto Mengual","userId":"16629741520207316219"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"iiDcFFLa3TsD","outputId":"96bf6378-462c-4de1-afe2-b5fdd68f1d1f"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-45ad26d2-4474-4fe6-9742-2116f0d95d94\">\n","    <div class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","      <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <th>1467810369</th>\n","      <th>Mon Apr 06 22:19:45 PDT 2009</th>\n","      <th>NO_QUERY</th>\n","      <th>_TheSpecialOne_</th>\n","      <th>@switchfoot http://twitpic.com/2y1zl - Awww, that's a bummer.

The less important words (i.e. those of very low number of occurrence) do not contribute much to the sentiment.

In our case, we will use the top 5,000 words with the highest frequency to build the features.\n","\n","In the cell below, combine all the words in `text_processed` and calculate the frequency distribution of all words.
