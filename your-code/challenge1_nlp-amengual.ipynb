The latter 3 steps are more advanced and not required for our next challenge on sentiment analysis. \n","\n","## Objectives\n","\n","* Learn how to prepare text data for NLP analysis in Python\n","* Write the functions you will use in Challenge 3 for cleaning, tokenizing, stemming, and lemmatizing data."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"vE7RZc1wqds-"},"source":["## Text Cleaning\n","\n","Text cleaning is also called text cleansing. The goal is to clean up the messy real-world textual data in order to improve the text analysis accuracy at later steps. For generic textual data sources, we usually need to fix the following problems:\n","\n","* Missing values\n","* Special characters\n","* Numbers\n","\n","For web data, we need to additinally fix:\n","\n","* HTML tags\n","* JavaScripts\n","* CSS\n","* URLs\n","\n","Case by case, there may also be special problems we need to fix for certain types of data. For instance, for Twitter tweets data we need to fix hashtags and the Twitter handler including a *@* sign and Twitter usernames.\n","\n","In addition, we also need to convert the texts to lower cases so that when we anaylize the words later, NLTK will not think *Ironhack* and *ironhack* mean different things.\n","\n","Note that the above are the general steps to clean up data for NLP analysis. In specific cases, not all those steps apply. For example, if you are analyzing textual data on history, you probably don't want to remove numbers because numbers (such as years and dates) are important in history. Besides, if you are doing something like network analysis on web data, you may want to retain hyperlinks so that you will be able to extract the outbounding links in the next steps. Sometimes you may also need to do some cleaning first, then extract some features, then do more cleaning, then extract more features. You'll have to make these judgments by yourself case by case. \n","\n","In this challenge we are keeping things relatively simple so **you only need to clean up special characters, numbers, and URLs**.

Because that will join words that shouldn't be joined. For instance, if you replace the `'` in `you're`, you will get `youre` which is undesirable. So instead, replace special characters and numbers with a whitespace.\n","\n","* The order matters in terms of what to clean before others. For example, if you clean special characters before URLs, it will be difficult to identify the URLs patterns.\n","\n","* Don't worry about single letters and multiple whitespaces in your returned string.
